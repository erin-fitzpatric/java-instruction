//Create a class named AnimalCounterApp that includes a static method that lets you
//count any Countable object a specified number of times. For example:
//public static void count(Countable c, int maxCount)
//
//As shown above, count an alligator 3 times. Then, (a) count a sheep 2 times, (b)
//clone the sheep, change the clone’s name, and count the clone 3 times, and (c) count
//the first sheep again 1 time.
